Hello everyone,

My name is Melissa and I am currently living in San Antonio, Texas. I am a GIS field technician and soon hope to apply GIS technologies to the world of planetary science (after I have finished my master's program). I love to take my two dogs on walks and listen to true crime podcasts.
